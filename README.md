# CoTeachPack (Anonymous)

This repository contains the anonymous code release for the paper submission on **group-conditioned teaching pack authoring** for heterogeneous classrooms.  
It includes: (i) the end-to-end pipeline, (ii) the verifier suite, (iii) experiment configs, and (iv) scripts to reproduce key tables/figures.

> **Appendix for deeper reading:** see `docs/APPENDIX.md` (in this repo).  
> It provides extended details (prompts, verifier definitions, additional examples, and implementation notes) beyond the main paper due to page limits.
